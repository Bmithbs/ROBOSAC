## Abstract

Multiple robots could perceive a scene (e.g., detect objects) collaboratively better than individuals, although easily suffer from adversarial attacks when using deep learning. This could be addressed by the adversarial defense, but its training requires the often-unknown attacking mechanism.

Differently, we propose **ROBOSAC**, a novel sampling-based defense strategy generalizable to unseen attackers. Our key idea is that collaborative perception should lead to consensus rather than dissensus in results compared to individual perception. This leads to our hypothesize-and-verify framework: perception results with and without collaboration from a random subset of teammates are compared until reaching a consensus. 

In such a framework, more teammates in the sampled subset often entail better perception performance but require longer sampling time to reject potential attackers. Thus, we derive how many sampling trials are needed to ensure the desired size of an attacker-free subset, or equivalently, the maximum size of such a subset that we can successfully sample within a given number of trials. We validate our method on the task of collaborative 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.



## Getting Started
- [Installation](docs/Installation.md/#installation)
- [Dataset Preparation](docs/Installation.md/#dataset-preparation)
- [Specifying dataset and checkpoint](docs/Installation.md/#specifying-dataset)



## Run ROBOSAC

in the directory of `AmongUs`:

```bash
cd coperception/tools/det/
```

```bash
python robosac.py [-d DATA] [--log] [--logpath LOGPATH] [--visualization]
                         [--pert_alpha PERT_ALPHA] [--adv_method ADV_METHOD]
                         [--eps EPS] [--unadv_pert_alpha UNADV_PERT_ALPHA]
                         [--scene_id SCENE_ID] [--sample_id SAMPLE_ID]
                         [--iteration_per_sample ITERATION_PER_SAMPLE]
                         [--robosac ROBOSAC] [--ego_agent EGO_AGENT]
                         [--robosac_k ROBOSAC_K] [--ego_loss_only]
                         [--step_budget STEP_BUDGET]
                         [--box_matching_thresh BOX_MATCHING_THRESH]
                         [--adv_iter ADV_ITER]
                         [--number_of_attackers NUMBER_OF_ATTACKERS]
                         [--fix_attackers] [--use_history_frame]
                         [--partial_upperbound]
```

**NOTE: Due to some data syncing issues, ROBOSAC cannot be performed under multi-GPU environment.** 

**You may need to specify CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES in front of python commands if you are using multiple GPUs:**

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python robosac.py [your params]
```
